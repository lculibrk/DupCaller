# DupCaller
DupCaller is a universal tool for calling somatic mutations and calculating somatic mutational burden from barcoded error-corrected next generation sequencing (ecNGS) data with matched normal (e.x. NanoSeq). 

**Prerequisites***
DupCaller requires python>=3.10 to run. Earlier versions may be sufficient to run DupCaller and have not been tested. 
The complete DupCaller pipeline also requires the following tools for data preprocessing. The versions are used by the developer and other versions may or may not work.
  * BWA          version 0.7.17 (https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net)
  * GATK         version 4.2.6 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases)
  * mosdepth     version 0.3.3 (https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth)
**INSTALLATION**
The tool uses pip for installing scripts and prerequisites. To install DupCaller, simply clone this repository and install via pip:
    '''bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlexandrovLab/DupCaller.git
    cd DupCaller
    pip install .
    '''

**Pipeline**

#### Trim barcodes from reads:
DupCallerTrim.py is a scripts that can extract 5-prime barcodes from paired-end fastqs. The usage is as follows:
    '''bash
    DupCallerTrim.py -i read1.fq -i2 read2.fq -p barcode_pattern -o sample_name
    '''
where
'read1.fq' and 'read2.fq' are fastq files from read1 and read2 of the paired-end sequencing data, respectively. Both unzipped and gzip compressed files can be correctly processed.
'barcode_pattern' is the pattern of barcodes starting from the 5-prime end, with N representing a barcode base and X representing a skipped base. The notation is similar to what has been used in UMI-tools(https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools). For example, NanoSeq uses 3-base barcode followed by 4 constant bases, so the pattern should be NNNXXXX.
'sample_name' is the prefix of output paired fastqs. After run complete, '{sample_name}_1.fastq' and '{sample_name}_2.fastq' will be generated.
The barcodes will be recorded in the each read name as {original_read_name}:{read1_barcode}+{read2_barcode}

If the matched normal is prepared in the same way as the sample, also apply the trimming with the same scheme to the matched normal fastqs. For traditional bulk normal, trimming is not needed.

#### Align trimmed fastqs
Use a DNA NGS aligner, such as BWA-MEM, to align the trimmed fastqs of both sample and matched normal from the last step. Notice that GATK requires read group ID,SM and PL to be set, so adding those tags during bwa alignment is recommended. For example:
    '''bash
    bwa mem -t {threads} -R "@RG\tID:{sample_name}\tSM:{sample_name}\tPL:ILLUMINA" reference.fa {sample_name}_1.fastq {sample_name}_2.fastq | samtools sort -@ {threads} > {sample_name}.bam
    samtools index -@ {threads} {sample_name}.bam
    '''
where
'threads' is the number of cores used for aligning
'reference.fa' is the reference genome fasta file
'{sample_name}_1.fastq' and '{sample_name}_2.fastq' are trimmed fastq file from last step.

#### (Optional) Running BQSR on sample and matched normal
Base quality score recalibration (BQSR) of the bam file is optional and can be performed following https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890531-Base-Quality-Score-Recalibration-BQSR-. The effect of BQSR on ecNGS variant calling is theoretically beneficial, since accurate base quality score can improve variant calling accuracy of lowly-duplicated read groups. 
 1. generate BQSR reports with GATK BaseRecalibrator:https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036898312-BaseRecalibrator
 2. Apply BQSR on the bam with GATK applyBQSR: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036856671-ApplyBQSR

#### MarkDuplicates with optical duplicates tags and new read name configuration
Run GATK MarkDuplicates on sample and matched-normal bams. Notice that optical duplicates and PCR duplicates should be treated differently in ecNGS variant calling, so the TAGGING_POLICY of GATK MarkDuplicates should be set to OpticalOnly to differentiate optical duplicate from PCR duplicate. Also, since the read name of trimmed fastq is non-traditional, the READ_NAME_REGEX option should also be set to "(?:.*:)?([0-9]+)[^:]*:([0-9]+)[^:]*:([0-9]+)[^:]*$". The MarkDuplicates commands should be looking like this:
'''bash
gatk MarkDuplicates -I sample.bam -O sample.mkdped.bam -M sample.mkdp_metrics.txt --READ_NAME_REGEX "(?:.*:)?([0-9]+)[^:]*:([0-9]+)[^:]*:([0-9]+)[^:]*$" --TAGGING_POLICY OpticalOnly
'''

#### Running mosdepth on normal bam file
We take advantage of the per-base coverage file generated by mosdepth

**INPUT FILE FORMAT**

This tool currently supports maf, vcf, simple text file, and ICGC formats. The user must provide variant data adhering to one of these four formats. If the userâ€™s files are in vcf format, each sample must be saved as a separate files.


**OUTPUT FILE STRUCTURE**

The output structure is divided into three folders: input, output, and logs. The input folder contains copies of the user-provided input files. The outputfolder contains
a DBS, SBS, ID, and TSB folder (there will also be a plots folder if this parameter is chosen). The matrices are saved into the appropriate folders. The logs folder contains the error and log files for the submitted job.

## STRUCTURAL VARIANT MATRIX GENERATION

### INPUT FORMAT:

***First six columns are required, and either the column "svclass" (deletion, translocation, tandem-duplication, or inversion) or the columns "strand1" & "strand2" (BRASS convention) must also be present***


### Example with SV class present (tsv or csv file):

| chrom1 | start1 | end1 | chrom2 | start2 | end2 | svclass |
| :-----: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 19 | 21268384 | 21268385 | 19 | 21327858 | 21327859 | deletion

### Example without SV class present (tsv or csv file):

| chrom1 | start1 | end1 | chrom2 | start2 | end2 | strand1 | strand2
| :-----: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 19 | 21268384 | 21268385 | 19 | 21327858 | 21327859 | + | +

### Quick Start Example: ###

```
#navigate to SVMatrixGenerator directory and start python3 interpreter

from SigProfilerMatrixGenerator.scripts import SVMatrixGenerator as sv
input_dir = "./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/SV/example_input/560-Breast" #directory which contains collection of bedpe files (one per sample)
output_dir = "./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/SV/"
project = "560-Breast"
sv.generateSVMatrix(input_dir, project, output_dir)
```
**Alternatively, you can run directly from the command line:**
```
python3 ./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/scripts/SVMatrixGenerator.py ./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/SV/example_input/560-Breast 560-Breast ./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/SV/example_output/ #provide input_dir, project, output_dir as command-line arguments
```
## OUTPUT:
1. Annotated bedpe file - a file with each SV annotated with its type, size bin, and clustered/non-clustered status
2. Aggregate SV plot - a summary plot showing the average number of events in each channel for the whole cohort of samples
3. SV Matrix - a 32 X n matrix (where n is the number of samples) that can be used to perform signature decomposition, clustering, etc.

## COPY NUMBER MATRIX GENERATION

In order to generate a copy number matrix, provide the an absolute path to a multi-sample segmentation file obtained from one of the following copy number calling tools (if you have individual sample files, please combine them into one file with the first column corresponding to the sample name):

1. ASCAT
2. ASCAT_NGS
3. SEQUENZA
4. ABSOLUTE
5. BATTENBERG
6. FACETS
7. PURPLE
8. TCGA

In addition, provide the name of the project and the output directory for the resulting matrix. The final matrix will be placed in a folder with the name of the project in the directory specified by the output path.

**An example to generate the CNV matrix is as follows:**

$ python3
```
>>from SigProfilerMatrixGenerator.scripts import CNVMatrixGenerator as scna
>>file_type = "BATTENBERG"
>>input_file = "./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/CNV/example_input/Battenberg_test.tsv" #example input file for testing
>>output_path = "/Users/azhark/iCloud/dev/CNVMatrixGenerator/example_output/"
>>project = "Battenberg_test"
>>scna.generateCNVMatrix(file_type, input_file, project, output_path)

```

**Alternatively, you can run directly from the command line:**

```
python ./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/scripts/CNVMatrixGenerator.py BATTENBERG ./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/CNV/example_input/Battenberg_test.tsv BATTENBERG-TEST ./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/CNV/example_output/
```
